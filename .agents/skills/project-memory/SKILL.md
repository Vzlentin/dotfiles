# project-memory

Long-lived memory for any project the agent works on. The vault is the
shared notebook between sessions: read it before acting on non-trivial work
and write to it whenever something durable is learned or decided.

## Vault resolution

The vault root is read from the `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` environment variable.

- bash / zsh: `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
- PowerShell: `$env:OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`

**Check the repo's `.env` too — don't trust an empty shell variable.** The
variable is often defined in `.env` rather than exported into the agent's shell;
many harnesses load `.env` for the app but not for your interactive shell, so
the live variable reads empty even when a vault is configured. Before concluding
the vault is unavailable, resolve the path from `.env`:
`grep OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH .env` (bash) or
`Select-String OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH .env` (PowerShell), and use that value as the
vault root. Treat the vault as absent only if neither the shell nor `.env`
provides a path.

Rules:

- **Optional but preferred.** If a path is resolved (from the shell or `.env`),
  use the vault as the source of truth for project memory.
- **Degrade gracefully, by surface.** If the vault is unset, empty, or absent,
  the fallback differs by what is being stored:
  - **Plans** fall back to the repo-relative `docs/plans/` store (see
    [Plan store location](#plan-store-location)). Plans are work orders, not
    private context, so they may live in the repo.
  - **Durable memory** (`architecture.md`, `vision.md`, `CONCEPTS.md`,
    `deferred-findings-register.md`, and the `solutions/` store)
    is skipped entirely — do not invent a path, fall back to a hardcoded
    location, or write it into the repo. These carry private context that must
    stay out of a (possibly public) repo.
- **No personal paths in the repo.** Never commit absolute vault paths into
  the codebase or documentation.

## Project folder

Each project gets exactly one folder inside the vault, named after the
repository directory:

```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/
├── architecture.md
├── vision.md
├── CONCEPTS.md                     # shared domain vocabulary
├── deferred-findings-register.md   # append-only rolling deferral log
├── plans/                          # one transient file per task
├── solutions/<category>/           # per-problem knowledge-track docs
└── campaigns/<name>/               # campaign state dirs (config, queue, log.jsonl)
```

This is the default durable surface. A project may declare additional owned
surfaces in its vault-side operating manual. Do not create a permanent file or
folder outside this set unless that manual declares it. `plans/` may contain
many transient files and `solutions/<category>/` many durable per-problem docs;
everything else listed is a single top-level file, except `campaigns/`:
each `campaigns/<name>/` holds a hand-maintained `queue` and optional
`config` plus a machine-appended `log.jsonl` ledger, owned by the
`campaign` loop (see its script header) — agents don't edit these except
through that loop.

## Plan store location

Plans resolve to one of two stores, depending on vault availability. This is
the single home for plan-location logic — callers (e.g. `/go`) delegate here
rather than hardcoding a path.

- **Vault mode** — `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` set and the project folder reachable:
  `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/plans/`. Resolve `<project>` by
  matching the repository directory name **case-insensitively** against
  existing `Projects/*` entries (so a repo dir `myproject` resolves to an
  existing `Projects/MyProject/`); if none matches, use the repo dir name
  verbatim, created on first write.
- **Fallback mode** — vault unset, empty, or absent: the repo-relative
  `docs/plans/` store. No vault paths are touched.

### Plan placement and relocation

A planning skill (e.g. `/plan`) writes a fresh plan to the repo at
`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<type>-<name>-plan.md`. Place it at the resolved
store:

- **Vault mode:** relocate it into the vault — rewrite its frontmatter to the
  vault convention (`title`, `type` (`feat|fix|refactor|chore`),
  `status: active`, `date`, and `origin` when known), write to
  `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/plans/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>.md`, verify
  the write, then delete the `docs/plans/` copy. One source of truth, no
  private context in a public repo.
- **Fallback mode:** leave the plan in `docs/plans/` as-is — it is already at
  the resolved store.

### Plan-status persistence

When a task reaches a terminal outcome, flip the plan's `status` in the resolved
store to `shipped` (merged) or `failed` (the run stopped short):

- **Vault mode:** set `status` on the vault plan, update `architecture.md` or
  one narrowly scoped `solutions/` note where a durable decision or reusable
  pattern warrants it, and commit the vault; push only if a remote is configured
  (it is its own git repo).
- **Fallback mode:** set `status` on the `docs/plans/` plan — that file is the
  record. Do **not** write durable vault memory; there is no vault.

## Solutions / deferred-findings store

Two durable surfaces beyond plans resolve here, both **vault-only** — they carry
private context and inherit the durable-memory degrade rule above (vault unset,
empty, or absent → **skip and note it**, never write the repo). Callers (e.g.
`/go`) delegate here rather than hardcoding a path, so there is one resolution
point and one skip rule.

- **Solutions store** — per-problem knowledge-track docs at
  `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/solutions/<category>/<slug>.md`
  (`<category>` ∈ `architecture-patterns`, `design-patterns`, `conventions`,
  `performance-issues`, `workflow`, …; each doc carries `module` / `tags` /
  `applies_when` frontmatter). This is the landing target when a caller compounds
  a learning on a shipped outcome: **relocate** the doc here using the same
  rewrite-frontmatter → write → verify → delete-the-repo-copy shape as a plan
  relocation, so no learning is left behind in the (possibly public) repo.
- **Deferred-findings register** — one append-only rolling table at
  `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/deferred-findings-register.md`. This
  is the landing target when a caller defers a finding (appending one row per
  deferred thread, keyed by PR/issue #, in the file's existing schema). Append
  only; never recreate, reorder, or rescope the file.

Resolve `<project>` exactly as [Plan store location](#plan-store-location) does
(case-insensitive match against `Projects/*`).

## File roles

- **`architecture.md`** — durable system design: module boundaries, data
  contracts, key invariants, deliberate trade-offs. Edited when a design
  decision lands.
- **`vision.md`** — product intent: goals, non-goals, north-star, scope.
  Edited only when product direction shifts.
- **`CONCEPTS.md`** — the project's shared domain vocabulary. Edited when a term
  is coined, sharpened, or retired.
- **`deferred-findings-register.md`** — one append-only rolling table of
  confirmed-but-deferred findings, keyed by PR/issue #. Rows are appended at
  deferral time; the file is never reordered or rescoped.
- **`plans/<slug>.md`** — one file per non-trivial task. Working memory:
  goal, plan, progress, outcomes. Update as the task evolves.
- **`solutions/<category>/<slug>.md`** — durable per-problem learning, filed
  under a knowledge-track category. Written when a reusable lesson is compounded
  on a shipped outcome.

## When to read

- At the start of any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural impact),
  read `architecture.md`, `vision.md`, and the related in-flight plan.
- Read only the smallest relevant `solutions/` notes, selected by category,
  frontmatter, or a targeted search. Never bulk-load the store.
- Before any architectural decision, re-read `architecture.md` and check
  `plans/` for a related in-flight plan.

## When to write

- **`architecture.md`** — when a design decision is made or an invariant
  changes. Keep entries terse; cite the change in the codebase.
- **`vision.md`** — only when goals, non-goals, or scope move.
- **`solutions/<category>/<slug>.md`** — create or extend one scoped note only
  for a reusable, project-specific pattern with concrete evidence. Do not
  persist every correction or one-off mistake.
- **`plans/<slug>.md`** — create at the start of any multi-step task,
  update through the task, leave behind as the record when complete.

## CLI usage

The vault is a directory of Markdown files. Use standard filesystem tools
(replace `<project>` with the repo name):

```bash
cat "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/architecture.md"
grep -r "<term>" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/solutions/" --include="*.md" -l
cat > "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/plans/<slug>.md" << 'EOF'
...
EOF
grep -r "<term>" "$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Projects/<project>/" --include="*.md" -l
```

If `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is unset, skip durable vault operations; plans still
resolve to the `docs/plans/` fallback (see [Plan store location](#plan-store-location)).
